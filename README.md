# Augmented Reality (AR)

Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that allows the user to interact with the digital world and its content in a more natural way. It is the result of merging real-world surroundings and digital content.

My first Web-based Augmented Reality was developed by combining AR.js, Aframe and CSS3. I created this project to find out what can be done with these technologies, as well as to learn how they work together.

The project is composed of two parts: an HTML5 demo (a web page), which uses Aframe and CSS3, and an AR application (a mobile app). The HTML5 demo displays a 3D cube composed of cubes with different colors. When the user points their phone at the cube, it projects a 3D cube in their environment that moves around when they move their phone.
